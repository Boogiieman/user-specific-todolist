# user-specific-todolist
This project was developed to understand and implement authentication and authorization in a Django-based application. The primary goal was to create a secure, user-specific To-Do List system. Each user could register, but their account required admin approval before they could log in, ensuring controlled access to the system. Role-based access was implemented, distinguishing between admins (who could approve or manage users) and regular users (who could manage their own tasks).

Tasks were linked to individual users, enforcing ownership and privacy while preventing unauthorized access to others' data. By combining authentication with role-based authorization, the project ensured a structured, secure, and user-friendly experience. The outcome was a robust understanding of securing web applications while managing user-specific functionality efficiently.
